Affinity (Übereinstimmung) OMP:

Given the arrangement of node, sockets, and cores, with different access to RAM 
and caches, we need to to make sure that our threads are located as close as 
possible to their data, and as close as possible to each other if they need to work on the same piece of data. 


OMP_PLACES: specifies hardware resources. The value can be either an abstract name describing a list of places
or an explicit list of places. Choices are threads, cores, or sockets.

    threads : Each place corresponds to a single hardware thread on the target  machine. 
    cores : Each place corresponds to a single core (having one or more  hardware threads) on the target machine.
    sockets : Each place corresponds to a single socket (consisting of one or  more cores) on the target machine.
    A list with explicit place values: such as"{0,1,2,3},{4,5,6,7},{8,9,10,11},{12,13,14,15}” 

OMP_PROC_BIND : controls how OpenMP threads are bound to resources.
Values  for OMP_PROC_BIND include close, spread and master

    spread: Bind threads as evenly distributed (spread) as possible
    close: Bind threads close to the master thread while still distributing threads for load balancing, wrap around once each place receives one  thread
    master : Bind threads the same place as the master thread
